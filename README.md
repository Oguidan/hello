# Hello Go

Welcome to my repository! This is where I document my journey learning Go, an open-source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

## About Go

Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming. It was developed by Google and is used in many of their internal systems.

## Learning Objectives

In this journey, I aim to understand:

- The basic syntax and semantics of the Go language
- How to write concurrent code using Goroutines and Channels
- How to interact with the file system using Go's standard library
- How to write unit tests and benchmarks
- How to build and distribute a Go application

## Current Progress

I'm just starting out, so there's not much to see here yet. But stay tuned for updates as I delve deeper into the world of Go!
